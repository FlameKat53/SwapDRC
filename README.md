# geckiine

This tool installs both TCPGecko and Cafiine into the system memory so that you can use them at the same time.

It was originally written by OatmealDome and modified by me with a selectable IP address menu added.  Releasing under the GPL the original source code was made under.

## Usage

### Prerequisites
* Wii U (on firmware version 4.1.0 or higher)
* Homebrew Launcher
* a cafiine server (examples: [the original by Chadderz and MrRean](https://github.com/MrRean/Cafiine-410-551/blob/master/server/cafiine_server.exe), [MusicRandomizer](https://github.com/OatmealDome/SplatoonUtilities/blob/master/MusicRandomizer/README.md), [Ray's custom server](https://github.com/Syroot/CafiineServer), and more)
* Your computer's local IP ([Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15291/windows-find-pc-ip-address), [macOS](http://osxdaily.com/2010/11/21/find-ip-address-mac/))

### Instructions

Load the app with the Homebrew Launcher.

1. Change the IP address using the D-PAD
2. Next press the A button with the correct IP for your PC selected and the cafiine server running on your PC
3. To take geckiine out of memory, reload HBL in browser
4. After reloading HBL, geckiine will be gone
5. If loading HBL fails, just reload the kernel
