# Credits

* Maschell for [HID to VPAD](https://github.com/Maschell/hid_to_vpad) which I used as a base for this application
* Dimok for his amazing function_hooks system and pygecko server
* NWPlayer123 for the [cafiine client source code](https://github.com/NWPlayer123/Cafiine-5.5.X), because this would have been harder for me to complete without it
* amiibu and seresaa for giving me name ideas
* Shoutouts to the people over at the Splatoon Modding Hub Discord, because I probably annoyed them by talking about the various problems I encountered.
